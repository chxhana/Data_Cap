The dataset encompasses a wide array of attributes including track titles, artists, albums, durations, popularity ratings, release years, and various audio features. Utilizing multiple regression modeling and analysis of variance techniques, the study investigates the factors influencing track popularity, with an emphasis on danceability, explicit content, and other audio features. The aim is to uncover significant relationships between these variables and popularity scores, thus shedding light on trends and patterns in contemporary music consumption. By examining a decade's worth of music data, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the reasons why people like certain types of music over others and highlights an understanding of how various factors work together to make songs popular or less popular. This analysis provides valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners interested in understanding and predicting music trends.
